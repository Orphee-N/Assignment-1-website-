                    <p> Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your athletic goals through motivation,
                        support,
                        and education. We have years of experience with athletes of all ages and abilities
                        and
                        we're happy to assist any athlete committed to pursuing his or her dreams.

                    <p>
                        We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and instruction; but we also offer small
                        group
                        practices. Our classes are never large in number. We believe that a low
                        coach-to-athlete
                        ratio provides the best results in the shortest time.

                <br>

                <p>Simal brings an extensive background in physiology and biomechanics to TSS and 18 years
                    of experience coaching in the health and fitness field. She is a USA Triathlon Level II
                    Certified coach and is certified in strength, conditioning, and bike fitting. Before
                    founding Tri and Succeed Sports, Simal built a private training studio for local
                    athletes.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p> Simal was a lettered volleyball player at the University of Texas and she picked up the
                    sport of triathlon after graduation. Triathlons have been her passion ever since. She
                    has competed in many short- to long-distance running, cycling, and triathlon events
                    including multiple races in IM Texas, IM Brazil, and IM Chicago.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Simal wants to provide personalized instruction to her athletes. She believes an
                    educated athlete is an athlete primed for success. Under her instruction, you will learn
                    not only what to do but why to do it.

                </figure>




                <p>Kevin is a student of body mechanics. In addition to a Bachelor's degree in
                    Kinesiology, Kevin brings certification in Swim Instruction and coaching. He has
                    coached numerous recreational and elite athletes, including Sprint and Ironman
                    triathletes.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    In addition to coaching individual athletes, Kevin has coached a variety of
                    teams and groups. Kevin coached Swimming and Cross Country at Austin High School
                    and Palmer Country Day School. As Head Coach, his swim teams set school records
                    in 9 out of 11 events, won the Mid-Texas Conference Championship, and
                    consistently finished in the top 3 at the Small School State meet. Kevin
                    currently coaches the Masters swim classes at TSS.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Since being talked into his first triathlon at 16, Kevin has always enjoyed the
                    challenge the sport provides. His motivation comes from the desire to improve
                    himself, not the desire to beat others. Starting as a middle of the pack
                    athlete, his initial goal was to work his way through the distances which
                    culminated with an Ironman finish in 2010. Bill remains a student of the sport
                    while helping others achieve their fitness and racing goals.

                <p>Fitness has always been a part of Tammy's life. Whether it was running, cycling,
                    or strength conditioning she has dedicated herself to fitness and a healthy
                    lifestyle. Trained as a mechanical designer, Tammy has designed commercial
                    strength products used in health clubs around the country. Her interests led her
                    to TSS, first as one of our athletes and then, 4 years ago, as a member of the
                    staff.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After completing her USAT certification training, Tammy designed the course of workouts we
                    use with our runners and cyclists. Tammy is also our nutritionist; she believes that
                    reaching one's fitness goals requires a holistic approach in which what goes into the body
                    is as important as what comes out.

                <p>
                    Coming from an engineering background, Tammy looks at things from an analytical point of
                    view. Recently Tammy completed two seminars on cycling with power meters. Tammy believes in
                    continuing education and has set her sights on receiving her USAT Level II certification and
                    USAT youth coaching certification.
